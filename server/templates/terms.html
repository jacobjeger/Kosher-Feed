  <h2>1. About ShiurPod</h2>
  <p>ShiurPod is a free Torah shiur listening application that aggregates publicly available RSS feeds. We serve as a technical directory and player — we are not a publisher and do not own the intellectual property of the shiurim found within the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use ShiurPod only for its intended purpose: listening to Torah shiurim. You may not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app.</li>
    <li>Use the app to distribute, republish, or commercially exploit the audio content.</li>
    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our servers or systems.</li>
    <li>Use automated systems (bots, scrapers) to access the app or its content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Content Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>All audio content available through ShiurPod is the property of the respective speakers, rabbis, and institutions who publish it. ShiurPod does not endorse, verify, or take responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or halachic rulings contained in the audio content. Users should consult their own rabbinical authority for halachic guidance.</p>

  <h2>4. No Modification of Content</h2>
  <p>We provide a direct bridge to the original RSS source. We do not edit the audio, remove content, insert advertisements, or alter the content in any way. Audio is streamed directly from the creator's hosting provider.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The ShiurPod app design, code, and branding are our intellectual property. The audio content, cover art, and feed descriptions belong to their respective creators. All rights are reserved by their respective owners.</p>

  <h2>6. Creator Requests</h2>

  <h2>8. Service Availability</h2>
  <p>ShiurPod is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service availability. We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time without notice.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ShiurPod and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the app.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
