  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 17, 2026</p>

  <p class="intro">ShiurPod ("we", "our", or "the app") is a free Torah shiur listening application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>ShiurPod does not require user accounts. We collect minimal data to provide our service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Device Identifier:</strong> A randomly generated ID stored locally on your device. This is not linked to your identity and is used solely to sync your playback progress, favorites, and subscriptions across sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Push Notification Token:</strong> If you enable push notifications, we store your device's Expo push token to send you alerts about new episodes from shiurim you follow.</li>
    <li><strong>Playback Data:</strong> Your playback position, favorites, and followed shiurim are stored to provide a seamless listening experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Form Submissions:</strong> If you contact us through the in-app form, we collect your name, email (both optional), and message content to respond to your inquiry.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your real name, email address, phone number, or any personal information unless you voluntarily provide it via the contact form.</li>
    <li>We do not use any analytics or tracking SDKs.</li>
    <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
    <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, camera, or microphone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Content & RSS Feeds</h2>
  <p>ShiurPod is a directory that aggregates publicly available Torah RSS feeds. Audio files are streamed directly from the original creators' hosting providers (e.g., Podbean, SoundCloud, Anchor). When you stream or download audio, your IP address may be visible to these external providers. We do not control their privacy practices and recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>Your playback data and preferences are stored on our secure servers (hosted on Replit with PostgreSQL). Anonymous device IDs are used as identifiers — no personal information is tied to these records. Contact form submissions are stored securely and accessible only to our admin team.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain playback and subscription data as long as needed to provide the service. Contact form submissions are retained for up to 12 months. You may request deletion at any time.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You may request the deletion of all data associated with your device at any time by using the in-app contact form (Settings &gt; Legal &gt; Contact) or by emailing us. We will process deletion requests within 48 business hours.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>ShiurPod does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app contains only Torah educational content and does not require any personal information to use.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, wish to request data deletion, or have any concerns, please contact us through the in-app contact form (Settings &gt; Legal &gt; Contact).</p>
